  </div>
  <div style="display: inline-block; width: 73%; vertical-align: top;">I'm an exuberant software developer, speaker, and open source contributor, with 10+ years experience building applications using the Microsoft technology stack. I specialize in developing cross-platform mobile apps using Xamarin technologies and am a 3-time Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer. <br/><br/>
  I live and work in the bustling center of "Silicon Prairie", Minneapolis MN, where I'm a Sr. Mobile Developer at <a href="https://www.mcomposer.com">Mobile Composer</a> and leading the development on our flagship moible app, Orchestrate.

In addition to my professional work, I also have a couple personal apps in the iOS App Store: [How Deep Is It?](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/how-deep-is-it/id955364125) and [Pickster](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pickster/id1055947478) (check 'em out, they're free!)

I regularly speak and attend the [MN Enterprise Mobile](https://www.meetup.com/Minnesota-Enterprise-Mobile) meetup, so if you're in the area, check it out.
