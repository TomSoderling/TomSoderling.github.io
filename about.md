### Hey! 

I'm an exuberant software developer, speaker, and open source contributor, with 10+ years experience building applications using the Microsoft technology stack. I specialize in developing cross-platform mobile apps using Xamarin technologies and am a 3-time Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer.  

I live and work in the bustling center of "Silicon Prairie", Minneapolis MN, where I'm a Sr. Mobile Developer at [Mobile Composer](https://www.mcomposer.com) and leading the development on our flagship app, Orchestrate.

In addition to my professional work, I also have a couple personal apps in the iOS App Store: [How Deep Is It?](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/how-deep-is-it/id955364125) and [Pickster](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pickster/id1055947478) (check 'em out, they're free!)

Specialties: C#, Cross-Platform Mobile Apps (iOS, UWP, Android), Xamarin.Forms, CI and Build Automation, Client communication, Leadership
