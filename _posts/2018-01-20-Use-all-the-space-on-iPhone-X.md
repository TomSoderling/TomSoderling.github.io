    <div style="display: inline-block; width: 80%; vertical-align: top;">The iPhone X has been out since early November (2017) and it is easily the best phone I've ever used. Great size, glass on glass on stainless steel design, wireless charging using Qi standard, fantastic gesture-based navigation, IP67 water resistant, convenient face ID, and the best camera I've ever owned. But topping the list is the screen; gorgeous, highly color accurate OLED that makes you think you're touching the very pixels. <br/>
    With that nice screen comes some extra space on top and on bottom. Space that all my old apps don't understand how to take advantage of. I've found myself struggling to remember each time how exactly to make use of that space, so here are the steps.

    <div style="display: inline-block;" align="top">
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/UseAllTheSpaceOniPhoneX/iphone-x.png" width="200" />  
    </div>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/UseAllTheSpaceOniPhoneX/iphone-x.png" style="width: 100px;"/>
