Sometimes you just need a new start.  
Here's an easy way to wipe out all the bits from an existing Visual Studio for Mac install so you can do a clean reinstall.  

You may want to save any code snippet files you've created. Copy this folder to a safe place so it doesn't get axed: `~/Library/VisualStudio/7.0/Snippet`  

## Wipeout

Run the first command on line 1 by itself first. You'll be prompted for your password.  

Then you can copy all the other commands and run them together.

 All clean! You can now download the [Visual Studio for Mac installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac) and begin your fresh new start.
