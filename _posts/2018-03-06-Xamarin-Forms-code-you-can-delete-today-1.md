    What's more fun than writing code?
    <br/><br/>
    Deleting it! 
    <br/><br/>
    Your Xamarin.Forms app definitely contains some code that you can delete. Code that is causing you a performance hit. Code you can delete today, right now, pronto, with no risk. <b>Seriously</b> 
    <br/><br/>
    Let's get philosophical for a moment. <br/>
    As much as we as developers really love to solve problems by writing code - _deleting_ code, (or writing less of it in the first place) should be a fundamental desire of mature developers who recognize that each line of code written is a trade-off: is this code worth the potential bugs and the cost of care and feed (maintenance) down the road?

## Good News for Deleters

This tip comes from the now-famous Optimizing App Performance with Xamarin.Forms talk that Jason Smith gave at the 2016 Xamarin Evolve conference. Even though the talk was given nearly 2 years ago, I/we/apps are still breaking many of the cardinal Xamarin.Forms no-no's and needlessly paying the price in performance.  

Here are the detailed steps to delete this code from your app:

1. Go to Visual Studio and search for LayoutOptions.Fill in your entire Xamarin.Forms solution  

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/XFCodeYouCanDelete/FindLayoutOptions.Fill.png" style="width: 300px;"/>

2. Delete all those lines of code. (I like to use cmd+x)



That's it!  


## But Why?

1. The default value of a view's HorizontalOptions and VerticalOptions properties [is _already_ LayoutOptions.Fill](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/user-interface/layouts/layout-options/#Overview), so it's completely unnecessary to set this.  

1. Every time you set it, your app is taking an unnecessary performance hit on the chin. Even though youâ€™re setting it to what it already was, it comes with a cost.
