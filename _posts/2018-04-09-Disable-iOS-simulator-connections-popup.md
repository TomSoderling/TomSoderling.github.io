<div>
    Deploying to the iOS simulators is great - so fast and convenient. 
    <br/><br/>
    What's <b>not</b> convenient and gets pretty downright annoying is being forced to click "Allow" on this popup EVERY SINGLE TIME I do it. 
    <br/><br/>
    Thankfully, you can use this handy little bash script to help silence this popup and deploy without interruption to the simulator. Sometimes, it's the little things.

## Uh... What Does This Script Do?

Yes, before downloading and running a bash script on your personal machine, you should probably know what it's doing. Especially since this script needs your password to execute the commands needed.
