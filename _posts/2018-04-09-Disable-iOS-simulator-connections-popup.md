Deploying to the iOS simulators is great - so fast and convenient.  

What's __not__ convenient and gets pretty downright annoying is being forced to click "Allow" on this pop-up EVERY SINGLE TIME I do it.  
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/DisableiOSSimulatorPopup/iOSSimulatorPopup.png" style="width: 500px;"/>  
*yes, for the love, just connect already and stop asking me*

Thankfully, you can use this handy little bash script to help silence this popup and deploy without interruption to the simulator. Sometimes, it's the little things that make a big difference.


## So What Does This Script Do, Exactly?

Yes, before downloading and running a bash script on your personal machine, you should probably know what it's doing. Especially since this one needs your password to execute the commands needed. Fear not, everything is on the up and up.
